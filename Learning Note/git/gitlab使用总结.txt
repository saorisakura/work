使用git clone命令克隆gitlab上面的项目的时候， 
出现了remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied fatal: Authentication failed for类似字眼的错误 
git clone http://账号:密码@git.ops.test.com.cn/root/puppet.git
git remote add kwd http://root:Gitlab,6Ro0ms@gitlab.example.com/root/kwd.git

卸载CentOS自带的Git

通过git –-version查看系统带的版本，Cento6.5自带的是git版本是1.7.1

yum remove git

安装前环境配置

 $ yum install -y curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel openssl-devel zlib-devel asciidoc xmlto perl-devel perl-CPAN autoconf*

下载git2.2.1并将git添加到环境变量中

># wget https://github.com/git/git/archive/v2.2.1.tar.gz
># tar zxvf v2.2.1.tar.gz
># cd git-2.2.1
># make configure
># ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/git --with-iconv=/usr/local/libiconv
># make all doc
># make install install-doc install-html
># echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/git/bin" >> /etc/bashrc
># source /etc/bashrc

查看版本号

># git --version
>git version 2.2.1

I'm on mac OS unlike this post: `git push origin <branchname>` throws error `HTTP Basic: Access denied` I have password configured in GitLab. I have SSL key created AFTER the project was made on GitLab.

When I use an existing folder for a new project and follow the steps below:

Existing folder

cd existing_folder
git init
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/sobopla/Geronimod.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
I am prompted to enter my GitLab username and password. After password is entered I get: remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://gitlab.com/myname/myproject'

git gitlab

It happen every time I'm forced to change the Windows password and none of above answers helped to me.

Try below solution which works for me:

Go to Windows Credential Manager (press Windows Key and type 'credential') to edit the git entry under Windows Credentials. Replace old password with the new one.

This is the right answer, if you have been using Git already on your machine for a long time. – Kaliyug Antagonist Jul 17 '18 at 8:36

Note that on Windows you need to run it as Administrator, otherwise you'll get permission errors – Eternal21 Aug 5 '18 at 1:34
Thank you, this worked for me using a MacBook pro – Ricardo Oct 14 '18 at 14:33

It depends where you put your credentials. If the previous command does not work try also using global flag: git config --global--unset credential.helper – Vincent Lunat Oct 15 '18 at 10:24 
This is the most relevant answer for the OP as it addresses the issue, and doesn't go on some "on Windows" tangent. Also, as a side note, you may need to run this command as sudo if your user doesn't have access to /etc – Ghostrydr Oct 17 '18 at 16:43

I got the same error and I solved this by :

Apply command from cmd

git config --system --unset credential.helper

And when I execute the above command, I got another error

error: could not lock config file C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64/etc/gitconfig: Permission denied

And then I removed gitconfig file from C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64/etc/ location (Note: this path will be different in MAC like "/Users/username")

After that use git command like git pull or git push, it asked me for username and password. applying valid username and password and git command working.
hope this will help you...
