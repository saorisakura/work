Firewalls and default ports
  
UPDATED: 2018-03-01 10:50
On some deployments, such as ones where restrictive firewalls are in place, you might need to manually configure a firewall to permit OpenStack service traffic.

To manually configure a firewall, you must permit traffic through the ports that each OpenStack service uses. This table lists the default ports that each OpenStack service uses:

Default ports that OpenStack components use¶
OpenStack service	Default ports	Port type
Application Catalog (murano)	8082	 
Block Storage (cinder)	8776	publicurl and adminurl
Clustering (senlin)	8778	publicurl and adminurl
Compute (nova) endpoints	8774	publicurl and adminurl
Compute API (nova-api)	8773, 8775	 
Compute ports for access to virtual machine consoles	5900-5999	 
Compute VNC proxy for browsers ( openstack-nova-novncproxy)	6080	 
Compute VNC proxy for traditional VNC clients (openstack-nova-xvpvncproxy)	6081	 
Proxy port for HTML5 console used by Compute service	6082	 
Data processing service (sahara) endpoint	8386	publicurl and adminurl
Identity service (keystone) administrative endpoint	35357	adminurl
Identity service public endpoint	5000	publicurl
Image service (glance) API	9292	publicurl and adminurl
Image service registry	9191	 
Networking (neutron)	9696	publicurl and adminurl
Object Storage (swift)	6000, 6001, 6002	 
Orchestration (heat) endpoint	8004	publicurl and adminurl
Orchestration AWS CloudFormation-compatible API (openstack-heat-api-cfn)	8000	 
Orchestration AWS CloudWatch-compatible API (openstack-heat-api-cloudwatch)	8003	 
Root Cause Analysis service (Vitrage)	8999	 
Telemetry (ceilometer)	8777	publicurl and adminurl
Workflow service (Mistral)	8989	 
To function properly, some OpenStack components depend on other, non-OpenStack services. For example, the OpenStack dashboard uses HTTP for non-secure communication. In this case, you must configure the firewall to allow traffic to and from HTTP.

This table lists the ports that other OpenStack components use:

Default ports that secondary services related to OpenStack components use¶
Service	Default port	Used by
HTTP	80	OpenStack dashboard (Horizon) when it is not configured to use secure access.
HTTP alternate	8080	OpenStack Object Storage (swift) service.
HTTPS	443	Any OpenStack service that is enabled for SSL, especially secure-access dashboard.
rsync	873	OpenStack Object Storage. Required.
iSCSI target	3260	OpenStack Block Storage. Required.
MySQL database service	3306	Most OpenStack components.
Message Broker (AMQP traffic)	5672	OpenStack Block Storage, Networking, Orchestration, and Compute.
On some deployments, the default port used by a service may fall within the defined local port range of a host. To check a host’s local port range:

$ sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range
If a service’s default port falls within this range, run the following program to check if the port has already been assigned to another application:

$ lsof -i :PORT
Configure the service to use a different port if the default port is already being used by another application.
