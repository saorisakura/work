Build instructions
To download and build QEMU 3.1.0:

wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-3.1.0.tar.xz
tar xvJf qemu-3.1.0.tar.xz
cd qemu-3.1.0
./configure
make
To download and build QEMU from git:

git clone https://git.qemu.org/git/qemu.git
cd qemu
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
./configure
make
The latest development happens on the master branch. The stable trees are located in branches named stable-X.YY branch, where X.YY is the release version.

Version numbering
Since version 3.0.0, QEMU uses a time based version numbering scheme:

major
incremented by 1 for the first release of the year
minor
reset to 0 with every major increment, otherwise incremented by 1 for each release from git master
micro
always 0 for releases from git master, incremented by 1 for each stable branch release
The implication of this is that changes in major version number do not have any bearing on the scope of changes included in the release. Non-backward compatible changes may be made in any master branch release, provided they have followed the deprecation policy which calls for warnings to be emitted for a minimum of two releases prior to the change.
