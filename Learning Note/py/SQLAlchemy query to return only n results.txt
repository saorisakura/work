SQLAlchemy query to return only n results?
Ask Question

I have been googling and reading through the SQLAlchemy documentation but haven't found what I am looking for.

I am looking for a function in SQLAlchemy that limits the number of results returned by a query to a certain number, for example: 5? Something like first() or all().

Use the limit method.

query.(Model).filter(something).limit(5).all()
