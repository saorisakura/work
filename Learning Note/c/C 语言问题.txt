Q: stu_management]# gcc -o main main.c 
main.c:4:19: fatal error: conio.h: No such file or directory
 #include <conio.h>
                   ^
compilation terminated.

A: conio.h is a C header file used in old MS-DOS compilers to create text user interfaces. Compilers that targeted non-DOS operating systems, such as Linux, Win32 and OS/2, provided different implementations of these functions.

The #include <curses.h> will give you almost all the functionalities that was provided in conio.h

nucurses need to be installed at the first place

In deb based Distros use

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

And in rpm based distros use

sudo yum install ncurses-devel ncurses

For getch() class of functions, you can try this
